									these are all fucking stupid options , what about a sysmtem agnostic application that runs in command line with its own custom commands after using a prefix ,
 									and it scans for nearby wifi connections and lists them alongside a security grade rating

 This is an excellent idea. It's a perfect blend of a practical utility, a demanding technical challenge, and a project that's much more impressive in C++ than in a scripting language. It's also an ideal candidate for using AI to help you navigate the tricky parts.

The core challenge of this project isn't the command-line interfaceâ€”that's relatively straightforward. The real technical hurdle is that network scanning is highly operating-system-dependent. There is no standard C++ library function to get a list of Wi-Fi networks. You will have to use a different approach for each major OS.

This is where the project becomes impressive and where AI assistance will be a massive time-saver. You'll demonstrate your ability to:

Write a cross-platform application.

Abstract away OS-specific details behind a clean C++ interface.

Interact with low-level system APIs.

Implement custom command-line parsers and command loops.

Apply logic to a real-world problem (security grading).

Project Breakdown & How to Leverage AI
Step 1: Design the Core Architecture
Before you write any code, design your application's structure. This is a task where you can use an AI to help you brainstorm and create a solid plan.

Command Processor: A central CommandProcessor class that takes user input, parses it, and dispatches it to the correct handler.

Networking Abstraction: A WiFiScanner interface with a scan() method. This is the key to your cross-platform design.

OS-Specific Implementations: Create separate classes that implement the WiFiScanner interface for each OS: WindowsWiFiScanner, LinuxWiFiScanner, and MacWiFiScanner.

Security Grader: A SecurityGrader class or function that takes a network's security parameters (e.g., encryption type) and returns a rating.

You can ask an AI: "Design a C++ class hierarchy for a cross-platform application to scan Wi-Fi networks. Include classes for a command-line interface, a Wi-Fi scanning abstraction layer, and OS-specific implementations for Windows, macOS, and Linux."

Step 2: The Command-Line Interface
This is the "fun" part. You'll need to create a simple loop that:

Prints a prompt (e.g., wifi-cli> ).

Reads a line of input.

Parses the input to find the command and its arguments (e.g., scan --all or exit).

Calls the appropriate method on your CommandProcessor.

How AI Helps:

Boilerplate: "Write a C++ command-line loop that reads from std::cin until the user types 'exit'."

Parsing: "Show me C++ code to parse a string like 'scan -v --all' into a command and a list of arguments."

Command Handling: "Help me design a C++ switch statement or std::map to handle different command strings and call their respective functions."

Step 3: The OS-Specific Scanning Logic (The Hard Part)
This is the most critical and impressive part. AI will be your navigator through a complex landscape of system APIs.

For Windows: You'll need to use the WlanAPI (Wireless LAN API) functions, specifically WlanOpenHandle, WlanScan, and WlanGetAvailableNetworkList. This is C-style code and can be verbose.

AI Prompt: "Write a C++ function to scan for nearby Wi-Fi networks on Windows using WlanAPI and list their SSIDs, BSSIDs, and security settings."

For macOS: You'll use the CoreWLAN framework. This requires a mix of C++ and Objective-C, known as Objective-C++. Your source file will need a .mm extension.

AI Prompt: "How can I get a list of Wi-Fi networks on macOS using C++? I know I need to use Objective-C++ and the CoreWLAN framework. Please provide a code snippet."

For Linux: The methods here are a bit more varied, but the most robust approach is using libnm (NetworkManager's C library) or iw (wireless tools). The nl80211 netlink interface is the modern, low-level way.

AI Prompt: "Show me how to get a list of Wi-Fi networks on Linux using the iw command and C++'s popen to execute the command and read its output." (This is a simpler, but less elegant, way to do it. A more advanced approach would use the low-level netlink sockets).

Step 4: Security Grade Rating
This is where you apply logic to the data you've gathered. The rating can be as simple or as complex as you want.

Simple Logic: WEP is "Very Bad," WPA is "Bad," WPA2-Personal is "Okay," WPA2-Enterprise is "Good," WPA3 is "Excellent." You can also penalize for open networks.

Advanced Logic: Incorporate other factors like channel width, signal strength (RSSI), and hidden SSIDs into the rating.

How AI Helps:

Helper Functions: "Write a C++ function that takes a string like 'WPA2' and returns a numerical security score or an enum for the security level."

Algorithm Refinement: You can ask the AI to help you brainstorm and refine your rating algorithm. "What are some factors beyond encryption type that I should consider when giving a Wi-Fi network a security rating?"

Final Impression
This project is fantastic. It's a genuine problem with real-world constraints that force you to work at a low level, which is a key strength of C++. It demonstrates mastery of:

Cross-platform development.

System programming and API interaction.

Command-line application design.

Resource management (since you're working with C++).

The ability to use modern tools (like AI) to solve complex problems efficiently.
